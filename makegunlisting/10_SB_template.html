S&W Smith & Wesson Model 10 .38 Spl - NO RESERVE


<p>This is a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 revolver, blued steel, with a 2" short barrel. The Model 10 is a classic police gun, but the snub-nose versions are less common and in high demand. It is a short-barreled K-frame revolver, not a J-frame, so it chambers 6 rounds (not 5) of 38 Special ammunition (will accept +P loadings). These revolvers are accurate, well-balanced, and well-crafted. They are easy to shoot, durable, and reliable.</p>

<p>This model is used, from police or guard company surplus. It has a _R_HAMMER_DESCRIPTION, and a _R_BUTT butt featuring _R_GRIPS grips. It has a _R_PARTS _R_TRIGGER_DESCRIPTION trigger and matching hammer. We grade it _R_GRADE, but the photos should suffice to make your own determination. Its lock-up is _R_LOCKUP. _R_NOTES</p>
